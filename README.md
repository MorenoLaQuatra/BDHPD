# BDHPD: Bilingual Dual-Head Architecture for Parkinson's Disease Detection from Speech

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper ["Bilingual Dual-Head Deep Model for Parkinson's Disease Detection from Speech"](link-to-paper), accepted at ICASSP 2025.

### Overview
BDHPD is a novel deep learning architecture designed for Parkinson's Disease detection from speech signals across multiple languages. The model employs:
- A dual-head architecture specialized for different speech tasks
- Self-supervised learning (SSL) and wavelet-based features
- Adaptive layers for cross-language generalization
- Convolutional bottlenecks for feature refinement
- Contrastive learning for enhanced discriminative capabilities

### Key Features
- Bilingual support (Slovak and Spanish)
- Specialized processing for diadochokinetic and continuous speech tasks
- Cross-language generalization capabilities

### Model Architecture
